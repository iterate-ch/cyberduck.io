            <h2>Cyberduck is <a class="ext" href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a>, but it
                still costs money to write, support, and distribute
                it.
                <small>
                    As a contributor to Cyberduck, you receive a registration key
                                    that disables the donation prompt that is displayed after installing or
                                    updating Cyberduck. You can use your credit card or bank account without the need to open a Paypal
                                    account. You will receive a receipt from Paypal when completing the transaction.

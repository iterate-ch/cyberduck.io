                <blockquote>
                    Every company is faced with the challenge of how to securely save, manage, and share digital data.
                    DRACOON, the Regensburg-based market leader in the field of enterprise file services in the
                    German-speaking region, has made it its mission to give the world back control of its data with the
                    help of its platform.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The DRACOON platform has been named a leader by top independent analysts like ISG, and various
                    certifications, seals, and assessments such as BSI C5, ISO 27001, and IDW PS 951 confirm that
                    DRACOON meets the highest standards of security.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    In line with the principle of privacy by design, DRACOON features built-in client-side encryption.
                    DRACOON offers maximum protection of both sent and saved files, because the owner is the only person
                    who has the decryption key. Not even the administrator or DRACOON as the service provider has
                    access. The highly granular user and rights management system makes it possible to define individual
                    permissions for all of the files saved to the platform. This allows authorized users to maintain
                    full control.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The universal API makes it possible to integrate external services and applications â€“ from secure
                    e-mail communication to the complete modernization of the companyâ€™s file services.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>

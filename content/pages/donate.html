                still costs money to write, support, and distribute it.

                    software</a> is a matter of the users freedom to run, copy,
                    distribute, study, change and improve the software. The continued donations of users is what allows
                    Cyberduck to be available for free today. If you find this program useful, please
                    consider making a donation or buy the version from the <a href="/appstore">Mac App Store</a> or <a href="/windowsstore">Windows Store</a>.

                <small> As a contributor (minimum amount 10 USD) you receive a registration key
                    that registers the installed application to your name and disables the donation prompt that is
                    otherwise displayed after installing or
                    updating Cyberduck. The registration key can be used on multiple computers but is personal and is not to
                    be shared.

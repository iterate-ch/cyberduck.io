          client for Mac OS X I ever tried. Is not because I like
          birds in general, but because it's the best.</q></p>

          <p><q cite="macfanatic.com">Forget the rest, this is the
          best! (...) I will never use another FTP
          client again.</q></p>

          <p><q cite="minglewithingle.com">Cyberduck is an
          outstanding FTP client for OS X. For the windows users
          out there, imagine if Filezilla was fast, and looked
          nice.</q></p>

          <p><q cite="Comment to macworld.com article">Nice
          article, but I don't use any those. I have found
          Cyberduck to totally and wonderfully take care of my FTP
          needs. It's just free and works great. I like the way it
          handles accounts too. It's interface is clean and easy to
          navigate. I give it 5 mouses.</q></p>

          <p><q cite="jeffpalm.com">I use Cyberduck and this is one
          reason that macs are way cooler than any other machines.
          I'm not saying they're better -- though they probably are
          -- just cooler. I mean, come on, it's a duck!</q></p>

          <p><q cite="ldopa.net">Cyberduck is hands down the best
          FTP client for Mac OS X. It's free under the GPL and in
          active development. It just keeps getting better. Give
          it a try.</q></p>

          <p><q cite="mac.dtgeeks.com">There are a number of FTP
          clients out for Mac OS X, ranging from (...). However,
          there is one FTP client that stands out. It's free,
          it's excellent, and it has a great name: Cyberduck!
          Cyberduck sports most of the features you'd expect from
          an FTP client, such as bookmarks, SFTP, the ability to
          toggle transfer modes, synchonization and so
          forth.</q></p>

          <p><q cite="wellheard.com">For FTP, Cyberduck is the way
          to go. Full featured, reliable and free. You can even get
          the source if you want.</q></p>

          <p><q cite="infovore.org">Fetch was sluggish and
          tempramental; Cyberduck is swift, easy to configure, and
          (so far) does everything I need.</q></p>

          <p><q cite="boingboing.net">I've been using David
          Kocher's Cyberduck FTP client for several months now.
          (...) All the other FTP clients I've used have been hard
          to learn and are confusing, but I've never had to look at
          the help file for Cyberduck. I don't even know if it has
          a help file. The bookmarking feature is well-implemented
          and I like being able to click on the BBEdit icon to edit
          any file on the server. (...) If you are looking for a
          simple, power FTP client, check this out.</q></p>

          <p><q cite="mactouch.com">Nombreux sont ceux qui ont
          besoin d'un client FTP (pour mettre à jour leur
          site perso par exemple). Les noms qui viennent
          immédiatement à l'esprit sont (...). Mais
          Cyberduck, qui existe depuis plus d'un an dans sa
          version Cocoa, vient les concurrencer.</q></p>

          <p><q cite="macreviewzone.com">It might lack the cachet
          of (...), but when it comes to FTP, David Kocher's
          open-source Cyberduck should be taken seriously. (...)
          Cyberduck is a robust FTP and SFTP application whose lack
          of visual clutter and cleverly intuitive features make it
          easy to use.</q></p>

          <p><q cite="nuclearpixel.com">I've been using Cyberduck
          for 4 months with no gripes at all. Cyberduck is a great
          little app that is in active development and doubles in
          quality every revision. Not to mention that it's free and
          open source.</q></p>

          <p><q cite="cecube.de">Cyberduck is <i>the</i> ftp
          software - I tell you, there is none better.</q></p>

          <p><q cite="macsnpods.com">You've got a Mac. You've got a
          web design app. You've made all of your website. It looks
          great! You can't wait to get it onto your server and
          share it with the world. Now, here comes trouble. How do
          you get it on your server? Well, there is a simple, free
          answer. What is it, you ask? Easy. It's
          Cyberduck.</q></p>

          <p><q cite="Victor">Cyberduck is a very fast FTP client.
          Easy to use, Cyberduck gives user real control. And best
          of all, is free. Donations accepted, indeed.</q></p>

          <p><q cite="hicksdesign.co.uk">I switched from (...) to
          Cyberduck about a year ago, and never looked back. A
          great little FTP app, in my opinion.</q></p>

          <p><q cite="Versiontracker.com Comment">I've used this
          product for 5 minutes and love it! It's much better than
          using the good ol' terminal.</q></p>

          <p><q cite="Versiontracker.com Comment">I recommend it
          to all our customers. It just rocks!</q></p>

          <p><q cite="Versiontracker.com Comment">I have given up
          that aweful (...) and have not looked back. I even sent
          the author a donation since I felt he richly deserved
          it.</q></p>

          <p><q cite="Versiontracker.com Comment">What else can I
          say? Its the best FTP program I've ever used. Its fast,
          stable, feature-filled, and free. I would recommend that
          anyone that uses (...), (...), (...), and those others
          try Cyberduck.</q></p>

          <p><q cite="Macupdate.com Comment">Wonderful, intuitive
          program that does what it's supposed to...and does it
          well.</q></p>

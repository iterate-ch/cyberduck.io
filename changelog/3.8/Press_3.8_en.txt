FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Cyberduck 3.8 Released

Bern, Dec 03, 2010

A major new version of Cyberduck is now available. The focus of version 3.8 is the integration of Amazon CloudFront CDN (Content Delivery Network) for the rest of us. With support for custom origins, there is no need to upload content to S3, but original content can be served from an ordinary web server and then distributed using the network of edge locations in the CloudFront CDN.

Cyberduck allows the setup and configuration of CloudFront custom origins with a straight-forward user interface. Additionally,a a new invalidation feature also allows to remove content from edge locations in CloudFront that have been accidentally distributed. Detailed information about configuration options can be found in the wiki documentation at [2].

There is now also support to connect to a Swift Storage (Openstack) installation, an emerging open standard for cloud storage server software.
